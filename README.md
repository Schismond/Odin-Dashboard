# Odin-Dashboard

This is a simple landing page built as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. The website is built using HTML and CSS and JS.

## Features

The goal of the lesson titled "Node Path - Intermediate HTML and CSS: Admin Dashboard" on The Odin Project website is to advance learners' skills in HTML and CSS by guiding them through the process of creating an admin dashboard for a web application.

By following this lesson, learners are expected to achieve the following objectives:

1. HTML Structure: Understanding the structure and semantics of HTML elements to create a well-organized and logical layout for the admin dashboard. This may involve using divs, headings, navigation menus, and other appropriate HTML elements.
2. CSS Styling: Applying CSS styles to the admin dashboard to create a visually appealing and cohesive design. This includes selecting suitable fonts, colors, backgrounds, and overall styling for different sections and components of the dashboard.
3. Responsive Design: Implementing responsive design principles to ensure that the admin dashboard is usable and accessible on various devices and screen sizes. This may involve using media queries, flexible layouts, and other responsive techniques.
4. CSS Grid/Flexbox: Utilizing CSS Grid or Flexbox to create a responsive and organized layout for the admin dashboard, allowing for proper alignment of elements and efficient use of space.
5. Data Visualization: Incorporating charts, graphs, or other data visualization techniques to present information in a clear and visually appealing manner within the admin dashboard.
6. Navigation and Menus: Implementing navigation menus or sidebars to enable easy navigation between different sections or pages within the admin dashboard.
7. Accessibility: Ensuring that the admin dashboard meets accessibility standards, considering factors such as proper use of headings, alternative text for images, keyboard navigation, and color contrast for visually impaired users.
8. UX/UI Considerations: Applying user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) principles to create an admin dashboard that is intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient for the intended users.

By completing this lesson, learners will have gained intermediate-level proficiency in HTML and CSS, specifically in the context of building an admin dashboard. They will have a solid understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, CSS Grid/Flexbox, data visualization, accessibility, and UX/UI considerations in the context of an admin dashboard for a web application.
